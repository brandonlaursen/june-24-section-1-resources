# Practice: Route Order Matters!

In this practice, you will debug and fix routing in Express.

## Getting started

Download starter. `cd` into the __server__ folder. Run `npm install`.

Run the application in developer mode (`npm run dev`), and open the root route
in your browser ([http://localhost:5000]). You should see the message "Server 
is alive".

Open __app.js__ for editing. All the changes you need to make will be in this 
file.

## Fix the routes

The following 3 routes should show the response specified for each one. Try
them to figure out which ones are working and which are not. Edit the __app.js__
file to get all routes working as specified.

### Route: `/hello`

Expected response: `Hello, my friend!`

### Route: `/goodbye`

Expected response: `Goodbye, my friend!`

### Route: `/goodbye/until/tomorrow`

Expected response: `Have a nice day! See you tomorrow.`

### Route: `/goodbye/until/forever`

Expected response: `So long. Farewell. Have a great life!`
