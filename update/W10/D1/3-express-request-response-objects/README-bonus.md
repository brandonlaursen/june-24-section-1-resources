# Bonus Practice: Express Request/Response Objects

**This is additional practice for Express request/response objects and route
handlers. You can use any problems you didn't complete as optional additional
practice for the assessment.**

As always, bonus phases are optional. If you can do them, then you know you are
understanding the Express server at a deeper level.

* Advanced Bonus Phase A - Respond with a JSON object using values from the
  request object
  * Run `npm test test/bonus/phase-a-spec.js` in the server folder to pass the
    specs for this phase
* Advanced Bonus Phase B - Research how to return static files in a public
  folder
  * Reference: [Static Files Documentation][static-doc]
  * Run `npm test test/bonus/phase-b-spec.js` in the server folder to pass the
    specs for this phase
