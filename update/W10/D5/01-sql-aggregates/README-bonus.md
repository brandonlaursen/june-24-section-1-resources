# BONUS Practice: SQL Aggregation

In this practice, you will formulate more SQL aggregation queries using
`GROUP BY` and `HAVING`.

## Step 1: `GROUP BY`

Write a query to list the number of toys per cat.

> HINT: You'll need a `JOIN` as well as the appropriate aggregate function(s).

## Step 2: `HAVING`

Write a query to determine which cats have been "spoiled" with two or more toys.
