# Practice: Eager and Lazy Loading Queries

In this short practice, you will explore the difference between eager and lazy
loading associated data in **Sequelize** queries.

## Getting started

Download starter. 

Execute the __setup-commands.sh__ script from the root directory of this
practice. 

```shell
sh setup-commands.sh
```

View the contents of the script to see the commands that are executed. View the
results in the terminal to confirm that setup was successful and the `Bands`,
`Instruments`, `Musicians`, and `MusicianInstruments` tables exists in your
database and you have seed data present. The tables created follow the following
schema:

![band-musician-instrument-db-schema]

In this practice you will be implementing the endpoints in __app.js__ which will
query your database for `Bands` and their associated `Musicians`. You will
compare how to perform these queries utilizing eager loading versus lazy loading
of data and be able to explain the differences in the resulting SQL that is
executed.

## Step 1: Compare lazy vs eager loading of data

Take a look at the route handler in __app.js__ for `GET /bands-lazy/:bandId`. It
returns the details of a specific `Band`. It fetches the band record by primary
key, then fetches associated `Musicians` using the `getMusicians` method
provided by **Sequelize** from the `hasMany` association that has been set up in
the model. After both of these fetches have been made, a `payload` object is
constructed with the data that is to be returned and a JSON response is sent.

> and examples of the methods provided by **Sequelize** associations.

Take a look at the second route handler, `GET /bands-eager/:bandId`, that returns the
exact same results as `GET /bands-lazy/:bandId`. However, the way that this route
handler retrieves and compiles its returned data is different. The associated
`Musician` data is eager loaded when the query to find a `Band` is executed. This is
accomplished by *including* the `Musician` model with the query, then ordering the
returned records by the `firstName` of the `Musician`.

Test that each of these endpoints fetches associated musicians by navigating to
the routes in your browser. If you haven't had to reseed your database,
navigating to both `/bands-lazy/2` and `/bands-eager/2` should yield the exact
same results as below:

```json
{
  "id": 2,
  "name": "America The Piano",
  "createdAt": "2021-10-21T21:51:14.000Z",
  "updatedAt": "2021-10-21T21:51:14.000Z",
  "Musicians": [
    {
      "id": 5,
      "firstName": "Georgette",
      "lastName": "Kubo",
      "bandId": 2,
      "createdAt": "2021-10-21T21:51:14.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2021-10-21T21:51:14.000Z"
    },
    {
      "id": 4,
      "firstName": "Marine",
      "lastName": "Sweet",
      "bandId": 2,
      "createdAt": "2021-10-21T21:51:14.000Z",
      "updatedAt": "2021-10-21T21:51:14.000Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

Take some time to compare the two approaches. Navigate between the endpoints
and compare the SQL generated for each (take a look at your server log as you
make requests). How many queries are needed for each endpoint? How does the code
compare?


## Step 2: Lazy loading all bands

In addition to the individual band endpoints, your API has endpoints to return
data about all `Bands`. You would like to expand these endpoints to include the
same associated `Musician` data as the individual `Band` endpoints.

The route handler for `/bands-lazy` currently fetches all `Bands` and orders
them by `name`. It then constructs a `payload` array by iterating over each
`Band` and adding the content from you would like to send back from this
endpoint as a new object. Finally, it sends a JSON response of the built up
`payload`.

You will modify the endpoint to use the provided getter function for finding the
`Musician`s for each `Band`, similar to the `/bands-lazy/:id` endpoint. Order the
`Musician`s by `firstName`. Add the musicians found to the `bandData` object
as the value to the `Musicians` property. The `bandData` object represents the
information of a single band.

Test that you were able to fetch associated musicians by navigating to the
modified route in your browser. Navigating to `/bands-lazy` should yield all
five `Bands`, ordered by `name`, with associated `Musicians` ordered by
`firstName`:


## Step 3: Eager loading all bands

You have a second route handler, `/bands-eager`, that you would like to return
the exact same results as `/bands-lazy`. This time, however, you would like to
eager load the associated `Musician` data when the query to find all `Bands` is
executed.

Modify the current query to include the `Musician` model. Be sure to order the
overall query first by the `name` attribute, then by the `Musician's`
`firstName` attribute.

Test that you were able to fetch associated musicians by navigating to the modified
route in your browser. Navigating to `/bands-lazy` should yield the exact same
results as in the previous step.


## Step 4: Compare the approaches

Now that the routes have been implemented, again compare the two lazy vs. eager
implementations. Navigate between the routes and compare the SQL generated for
each (take a look at your server log as you make requests). How many queries are
needed for each route? How does the code compare? How do these approaches
compare as the number of records being worked with increases?


## BONUS: More association practice

This practice includes `Bands` with a one-to-many association with `Musicians`,
as you have worked with in the previous route handlers, but it also includes
`Instruments` with a many-to-many association with `Musicians`. See if you can
implement more endpoints (or expand upon those that you just worked with) that
take advantage of these associations.


## Congratulations!

You are now able to utilize lazy and eager loading of associated data with
**Sequelize**, as well as explain the consequences of the SQL produced.
