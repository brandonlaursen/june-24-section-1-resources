# Practice: Serving Static Files in Express

In this practice, you will serve static files inside the folder of an Express
application.

## Set up

`npm install` the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the server at [http://localhost:5000] in
development.

## Part 1: File paths appended to a resource

In your `server` folder, there is a folder called `assets` that holds CSS
stylesheets, images, and JavaScript scripts.

Serve the files in the `assets/css` folder under a route resource called
`stylesheets` (URL prefix is `/stylesheets` and the root folder is
`assets/css`).

If done correctly, you should see the following assets at the respective URL
paths when you navigate to the URLs in the browser:

- `assets/css/application.css` - [http://localhost:5000/stylesheets/application.css]

You should **NOT** see the following assets at the respective URL paths:

- `assets/css/application.css` - [http://localhost:5000/css/application.css]
- `assets/scripts/hello-world.js` - [http://localhost:5000/scripts/hello-world.js]

## Part 2: File paths appended to root URL

Serve all the files in the `assets` folder so that if you append the relative
file path to the end of the root URL of the server, it will send the file to the
client.

If done correctly, you should see the following assets at the respective URL
paths when you navigate to the URLs in the browser:

- `assets/css/application.css` - [http://localhost:5000/css/application.css]
- `assets/scripts/hello-world.js` - [http://localhost:5000/scripts/hello-world.js]
- `assets/images/hello.png` - [http://localhost:5000/images/hello.png]

## Part 3: File paths appended to root URL II

Comment out the code that you wrote previously.

Serve only the files in the `assets/scripts` folder **at the root URL**.

If done correctly, you should see the following assets at the respective URL
paths when you navigate to the URLs in the browser:

- `assets/scripts/hello-world.js` - [http://localhost:5000/hello-world.js]

You should **NOT** see the following assets at the respective URL paths:

- `assets/application.css` - [http://localhost:5000/application.css]
- `assets/css/application.css` - [http://localhost:5000/css/application.css]
- `assets/scripts/hello-world.js` - [http://localhost:5000/scripts/hello-world.js]
- `assets/images/hello.png` - [http://localhost:5000/images/hello.png]

[http://localhost:5000]: http://localhost:5000

[http://localhost:5000/stylesheets/application.css]: http://localhost:5000/stylesheets/application.css

[http://localhost:5000/css/application.css]: http://localhost:5000/css/application.css
[http://localhost:5000/scripts/hello-world.js]: http://localhost:5000/scripts/hello-world.js
[http://localhost:5000/images/hello.png]: http://localhost:5000/images/hello.png

[http://localhost:5000/hello-world.js]: http://localhost:5000/hello-world.js
[http://localhost:5000/application.css]: http://localhost:5000/application.css
