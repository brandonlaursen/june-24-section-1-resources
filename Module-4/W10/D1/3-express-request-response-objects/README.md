# Practice: Express Request/Response Objects

In this practice, you will explore the request and response objects in Express.

## Getting started

Download the starter. `cd` into the __server__ folder, and run `npm install`.

Open __server/app.js__ and notice the framework for an Express server has been
created for you. In between the Express initialization and the listener are a
series of phases for you to complete.

Start the server using `npm run dev` (for automatic restarting of the server on
any file save). Open your browser to [http://localhost:8000].

> Remember to refresh the browser after the server restarts whenever you make
> changes to the code **and save** the code.

## Phases

* Basic Phase 1 - Plain-text response
  * Run `npm test test/phase-1-spec.js` in the server folder to pass the
    specs for this phase
* Basic Phase 2 - Route param and JSON response
  * Run `npm test test/phase-2-spec.js` in the server folder to pass the
    specs for this phase
* Basic Phase 3 - Query params in URL
  * Run `npm test test/phase-3-spec.js` in the server folder to pass the
    specs for this phase

[http://localhost:8000]: http://localhost:8000
