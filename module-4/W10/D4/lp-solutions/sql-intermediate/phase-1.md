# Basic Phase 1: Designing Database Schemas

In this phase, you will design a database schema using a database schema
visualization tool of your choice.

## Cats, Owners, and Toys

Create a database schema that features the following resources:

- Cats
  - `name` - name of the cat
  - `birth_year` - birth year of the cat
- Owners
  - `first_name` - first name of the owner
  - `last_name` - second name of the owner
- Toys
  - `name` - name of the toy

Here are the relationships between the resources:

Cats can be owned by multiple owners. Owners can have multiple cats. Cats can
have many toys. A toy can only be owned by a single cat.

**Do not move on to Phase 2 until you have finished Phase 1!**
