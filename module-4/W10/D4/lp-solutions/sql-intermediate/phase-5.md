# Basic Phase 5: SELECT Clauses

In this phase, you will create queries using different SELECT clauses.

Write your SQL queries in `sql-practice/phase-5` folder. You can run
the file by executing it in the terminal:

```shell
sqlite3 practice.db ".read phase-5/query-1.sql"
sqlite3 practice.db ".read phase-5/query-2.sql"
sqlite3 practice.db ".read phase-5/query-3.sql"
sqlite3 practice.db ".read phase-5/query-4.sql"
sqlite3 practice.db ".read phase-5/query-5.sql"
```

What do you expect as the output of the SQL query? Does your query results
match what you expected?
