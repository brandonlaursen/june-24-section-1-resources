# Express-SQL 1 Practice Assessment - SQL

Welcome to the SQL assessment!

This assessment tests your ability to make good database design choices for a
given scenario. It also tests your ability to formulate appropriate SQL query
and delete statements in response to specific events.

Your objective is to complete the files in the __sql-files__ directory so that
all test specs pass. Each spec is worth 1 point.

* __Total Possible Points:__ 20 points

You will have **90 minutes** to complete the assessment.

## Resources

During the actual assessment, you will be allowed to use the following
resources:

* [MDN]
* A whiteboard or paper to work out problems/code, but it must be within camera
  range
* VS Code or a console for coding, testing, and experimentation
* Node
* Postman (when useful)
* Official documentation, including:
  * [ExpressJS]
  * [SQLite3]

You are **NOT** allowed to refer to any other resources, including--but not
limited to--other websites (e.g., AA Open, StackOverflow), communication apps
(e.g., Slack, Discord), search engines, notes, or any of your previously
written code.

[ExpressJS]: http://expressjs.com/
[SQLite3]: https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html


## Setup

1. Finish reading this __README__ in its entirety.
2. Clone this starter repo and open it in VS Code.
   * **Make sure your folder's local path has no spaces!** Otherwise,
     dependencies may not install correctly. (Use `pwd` to see the current
     path.)
     * Bad:  __/.../App Academy/aa10-assessment__
     * Good: __/.../App-Academy/aa10-assessment__
3. Run `npm install` in the root directory.
4. Run `npm test` to see all the specs you need to pass.
5. Read the __Scenario.md__ file to get started!

## Submission (ONLY FOR ACTUAL ASSESSMENT)

> The following are the submission instructions for the actual assessment. They
> will not work for submitting the practice assessment but are printed here so
> you can familiarize yourself with them.

When you are ready to submit:

1. Run `npm test` in the root directory to re-run all of the tests.
  
2. Fix any syntax errors that cause the tests to crash. **If a test crashes or
   the tests fail to complete their run, you will receive a 0 for the coding
   portion of this assessment.** You can fail specs, but all the tests have to
   be able to finish running.

   **Tip:** If you run out of time to debug, just comment out any code that is
   causing your programs to crash.

3. Add, commit, and push your changed files:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Finish the assessment (or some such descriptive message)"
   git push
   ```

   **Note:** The first time you run `git push`, git will tell you to run a more
   complete version of the command:

   ```sh
   git push --set-upstream origin <your branch>
   ```

You can run tests, `add` files, and `commit` files as often as you wish, but
only your first **two pushes** will be graded. (If for some reason you need more
than two pushes, you must plead your case to an Instructor.)
