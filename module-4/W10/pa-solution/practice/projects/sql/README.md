# Express-SQL 1 Practice Assessment - SQL

Welcome to the SQL Practice Assessment!

This assessment tests your ability to make good database design choices for a
given scenario. It also tests your ability to formulate appropriate SQL query
and delete statements in response to specific events.

Your objective is to complete the files in the __sql-files__ directory so that
all test specs pass. Each spec is worth 1 point.

* __Total Possible Points:__ 20 points

You will have **90 minutes** to complete the assessment.

## Resources

For this assessment, you are allowed to use the following resources:

<!--!!FT -->
* [MDN]
* A whiteboard or paper to work out problems/code, but they must be within
  camera range
* VS Code or a console for coding, testing, and experimentation
* Node
* Postman (when useful)
* Official documentation, including:
  * [ExpressJS]
  * [SQLite3]

You are **NOT** allowed to refer to any other resources, including--but not
limited to--other websites (e.g., a/A curriculum on Canvas, StackOverflow),
communication apps (e.g., Slack, Discord), search engines, notes, or any of your
previously written code.

* Postman (when useful)
* Official documentation, including:
  * [ExpressJS]
  * [SQLite3]
* Previously written code you wrote yourself
  * Except for code from previous assessment submissions
* Comments within code
  * If there are comments in your code about your specific code and about what
    your code is doing, that is appropriate. If your comments are about concepts
    and based on the readings, then that counts as notes. Those would not be
    appropriate.

You are **NOT** allowed to refer to any other resources, including--but not
limited to--other websites (e.g., StackOverflow), communication apps (e.g.,
Slack, Discord), search engines, notes, or code from previous assessment
submissions.

## Setup

1. Finish reading this __README__ in its entirety.
2. Clone this starter repo and open it in VS Code.
   * **Make sure your folder's local path has no spaces!** Otherwise,
     dependencies may not install correctly. (Use `pwd` to see the current
     path.)
     * Bad:  __/.../App Academy/aa10-assessment__
     * Good: __/.../App-Academy/aa10-assessment__
3. Run `npm install` in the root directory.
4. Run `npm test` to see all the specs you need to pass.
5. Read the __Scenario.md__ file to get started!

## Submission (ONLY FOR ACTUAL ASSESSMENT)

> The following are the submission instructions for the actual assessment. They
> will not work for submitting the practice assessment but are printed here so
> you can familiarize yourself with them.

When you are ready to submit:

1. Run `npm test` in the root directory to re-run all of the tests.
  
2. Fix any syntax errors that cause the tests to crash. **If a test crashes or
   the tests fail to complete their run, you will receive a 0 for the coding
   portion of this assessment.** You can fail specs, but all the tests have to
   be able to finish running.

   **Tip:** If you run out of time to debug, just comment out any code that is
   causing your programs to crash.

3. Add, commit, and push your changed files:

   ```sh
   git add .
   git commit -m "Finish the assessment (or some such descriptive message)"
   git push
   ```

   **Note:** The first time you run `git push`, git will tell you to run a more
   complete version of the command:

   ```sh
   git push --set-upstream origin <your branch>
   ```

You can run tests, `add` files, and `commit` files as often as you wish, but
only your first **two pushes** will be graded. (If for some reason you need more
than two pushes, you must plead your case to an Instructor.)
