# Long Practice: Express Middleware

In this project, you will be connecting boilerplate middleware to your Express
application and creating your own middleware.

## Set up

Download the starter.

`cd` into the `server` folder.

`npm install` the dependencies.

Run `npm run dev` to start the server at [http://localhost:5000] in
development.

[http://localhost:5000]: http://localhost:5000

## Phases

Here is the list of all the phases in this practice:

1. Boilerplate Express Middleware (Basic)
   - familiarize yourself with some boilerplate Express middleware and how to
     use them in an Express application
2. Creating Express Middleware (Basic)
   - create Express middleware and connect them to an Express application
3. API Resource Routers (Basic)
   - create Express routers and connect them to an Express application
4. Development vs. Production Error Handling (Intermediate)
   - handle Express errors differently depending on the environment
5. Nested Resources (Intermediate)
   - create nested Express routers and connect them to an Express application
     or router
