# Intermediate Bonus Phase 2: Routes For Insects

In this bonus phase, if you choose to do it, you will practice creating 
**Express** routes which return data using **Sequelize**.

Open __server/routes/insects.js__. Notice there are no routes here, yet.

Your mission is to create the routes for the `Insects` to have the same
functionality as the `Trees`.

* List of insects returning `id`, `name`, and `millimeters` ordered by
  `millimeters` from smallest to largest
* Fetch an insect by `id`
* Create an insect
* Delete an insect
* Update an insect
* Search for an insect by `name`

To test your knowledge, see how much you can do without references, and don't be
afraid to copy/paste or look up whatever code you want to make sure you remember
correctly.
