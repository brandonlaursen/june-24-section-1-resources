# Long Practice: Using Sequelize In Express Routes

In this long practice, you will be using **Sequelize** in an **Express** server
to run migrations, seed the database, and connect `GET`, `PUT`, `DELETE` and
`UPDATE` routes to their appropriate database operations.

This project parallels one you completed in SQL. Hopefully through this process,
you'll develop a better appreciation for the power of **Sequelize** to simplify
database operations.

## Getting started

Download the starter.

`cd` into the __server__ folder.

Install dependencies inside the __server__ folder using `npm install`. This will
install dependencies within the __server__ folder.

Create a __server/.env__ file in order to store
environment variables. Add a variable `DB_FILE` (which is already in use in
__server/config/database.js__). You can model the __.env__ file after
__.env.example__, specifying the location of the database to be created.

Notice that the starter includes __server/.sequelizerc__ and
__server/config/database.js__, as well as __migrations__, __models__, and
__seeders__ in the __server/db__ folder.

### Migrations and seeders

Run the appropriate `migrate` command using the **Sequelize CLI** to create the
database and the table(s) specified in the existing migrations.

> Remember: You'll need `dotenv` before `npx` in order to set the
> environment variable for the database file location.

Verify that the __db/dev.db__ file was created. If you encounter any
errors or do not see this file, go back and check that your __.env__ file has
been accurately set up.

Verify the table exists by checking its `schema` using the **SQLite3 CLI**.

Run the appropriate seed command using the **Sequelize CLI**.

Verify the table has data using the **SQLite3 CLI**.

### Run the application

Start the **Express** server in development mode using

```sh
npm run dev
```

In your browser or **Postman**, load the root path:
[http://localhost:5000/][localhost]

If all is working correctly, you should see
`{"message":"API server is running"}`.

## Phases

This project has been broken down into phases. Complete as much as you can in
the time allotted. You can complete any remaining phases for additional practice
during assessment prep.

If you get stuck, try moving on to the next phase for now, then come back later
in the project to complete or improve your code. Also, you can formulate good
questions, and reach out to your instructors for help.

## References

You may refer to your previous work, the [Sequelize documentation][docs], the
documentation for [Sequelize CLI][cli-docs], or online resources to assist you
in completing this practice.

Good luck! You can do it!!!

## Submission

After you are done with all the phases, submit your work. Make sure to delete
the `node_modules` folder in the __server__ directory!

1. Delete the `node_modules` folder in the __server__ directory
2. Zip up the project folder
3. Submit the zip file
