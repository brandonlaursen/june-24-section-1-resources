# Phase 4, Part 1 - Fans and Teams (CRUD with Associations)

Run `npm test test/part-1-spec` to make sure you pass all the specs in this
part.

## GET /fans/:fanId/drafts

The `GET /fans/:fanId/drafts` endpoint should return all the `Player`s that the
`Fan` specified by `fanId` is associated with.

For example, a request to `GET /fans/2/drafts` should return something like
this (`DraftPick` property on each `Player` is not needed):

```json

## DELETE /fans/:id

The `DELETE /fans/:id` endpoint should delete the `Fan` specified by `id` which
should also trigger a cascade deletion of all its associated `DraftPick`s.

For example, a request to `DELETE /fans/2` should delete the `Fan` specified by
`id` from the database and the `DraftPick`s with `id`s of `8`, `14`, `6`, and
`15`. Make sure to use cascade deletion in the database schema to achieve this
instead of manually finding and deleting the `DraftPick`s. The endpoint should
return something like this:

```json
{
  "message": "Successfully deleted"
}
```

## POST /teams/:id/players

Create a new draft player in the `Players` table that is associated with an
existing `Team` specified by its `id` attribute.

Request:

* Method: `POST`
* Example URL: `/teams/1/players`
* Headers:
  * Content-Type: application/json
* Example Body:

  ```json
  {
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "number": 13,
    "isRetired": false
  }
  ```

Response:

* Status Code: `200`
* Headers:
  * Content-Type: application/json
* Example Body:

  ```json
  {
    "id": 16,
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "number": 13,
    "isRetired": false,
    "currentTeamId": 1,
    "updatedAt": "2022-07-06T18:39:51.409Z",
    "createdAt": "2022-07-06T18:39:51.409Z"
  }
  ```
