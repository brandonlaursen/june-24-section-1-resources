Run `npm test test/part-3-spec` to make sure you pass all the specs in this

something like this:

```json
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Soccer",
        "createdAt": "2022-04-21T19:16:09.694Z",
        "updatedAt": "2022-04-21T19:16:09.694Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 3,
        "name": "Basketball",
        "createdAt": "2022-04-21T19:16:09.694Z",
        "updatedAt": "2022-04-21T19:16:09.694Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Baseball",
        "createdAt": "2022-04-21T19:16:09.694Z",
        "updatedAt": "2022-04-21T19:16:09.694Z"
    },
    {
        "id": 4,
        "name": "American Football",
        "createdAt": "2022-04-21T19:16:09.694Z",
        "updatedAt": "2022-04-21T19:16:09.694Z"
    }
]
```
