# Phase 4, Part 2 - Teams (Eager Loading)

Run `npm test test/part-2-spec` to make sure you pass all the specs in this
part.

## GET /teams/:id

The `GET /teams/:id` endpoint should return the `Team` specified by its
`id` and all its associated `Sport`(s) and `Player`(s). The `Player`(s) should be listed under the property `TeamRoster`.

For example, a request to `GET /teams/7` should return something like this:

```json

    "id": 7,
    "name": "Los Angeles Lakers",
    "homeCity": "Los Angeles",
