# Long Practice: API Server for a Music Archive

**Finish the [API docs for a Music Archive practice] before this practice.**

In this practice, you will implement the code for the server that you documented
in the previous [API docs for a Music Archive practice].

## Set up

Clone the project from the [starter].

## Instructions

Take a look at the server code in __server.js__. `GET /artists` is already
implemented for you. The seed data for artists, albums, and songs are imported
from the JSON files in the __seeds__ folder. The seed data for `artists`,
`albums`, and `songs` saved to variables at the top of the __server.js__ file.

Implement the code for the endpoints that you documented in the API docs for a
Music Archive practice.

After you implement the code for each endpoint, test the endpoint with Postman
and/or in the browser's "Console" tab using `fetch`.

Make sure your server's request-response for every endpoint matches the example
server that you used to help you create the API documentation.
