# Parse the Body of a Request Phase 1 - Creating the Server

In this phase, you will create a server and listen for requests on a specified port. Make sure you `npm install` first before running the server and test specs. 

Create a server using the `http` module. Allow the server to listen for requests on
port 5000 by reassigning the provided `server` variable. Log the message "Successfully
started the server on port 5000" after the server starts. Make sure you reassign the server
variable provided to you and run the test files with `npm test`.
