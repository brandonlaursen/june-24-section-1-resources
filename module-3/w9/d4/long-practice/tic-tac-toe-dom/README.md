# Long Practice: Tic-Tac-Toe DOM

In this practice, you will create a well-designed HTML+CSS+JS browser-based
application that will allow you to play [Tic-Tac-Toe][tic-tac-toe]. It will
combine all of the concepts that you learned in HTML and CSS, browser basics,
element selection and handling, and storage.

## Set up

1. Clone the practice from the starter.

2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.

3. Run `node app.js` from the base directory to start the server which will
serve the static assets in the practice.

4. Navigate to [http://localhost:5000] in your browser to see the
__public/index.html__ file rendered.


## Background and Context

In the starter, you will find the following files in the __public__ directory:

* __public/index.html__: The HTML file that you'll modify to structure your UI
* __public/main.css__: The CSS file that you'll modify to style your UI
* __public/tic-tac-toe.js__: The JavaScript file you'll modify to add behavior
  to your game.

**Important Note:** Use the images in the __wireframes__ directory as guidelines
for the expected behavior of completing each phase.

The goal of this practice is for you to apply everything you've learned about
building a web application with minimal guidance and hints. Time to get started!

## Phase 1: The UI

The first step to complete on your way to a minimum viable product is to
build the front-end for the game. The UI should look like this:

![sketch]

The interface should include the following elements:

* A heading in which the game will announce a winner when the game ends
  (or a tie if that happens). The heading should be horizontally center aligned.
* A 3x3 grid for the playing surface. You should try to use either the
  _flexbox_ or _grid_ layouts to achieve this.
    * Each cell on the game board must use the following ids, in the correct order below:
        |                |                |                |
        |----------------|----------------|----------------|
        | __"square-0"__ | __"square-1"__ | __"square-2"__ |
        | __"square-3"__ | __"square-4"__ | __"square-5"__ |
        | __"square-6"__ | __"square-7"__ | __"square-8"__ |

* Two buttons at the bottom. One that reads exactly "New Game" on the left, and
  one that reads exactly "Give Up" on the right. You should try to use either
  _flexbox_ or _grid_ layouts to achieve this.
* The entire UI should be horizontally center aligned in the page.

Apply paddings and margins where necessary to avoid overcrowding of components.
Remember, whitespace positioning is just as important as the actual UI elements'
positioning.

Run `npm run test-1` when you have completed this phase to check that the HTML
elements in your UI meet the minimum specs to move on with the project.

## Phase 2: Tracking Clicks

In this step, you will track the clicks of the players and fill the grid with
the appropriate symbols.

* For the "X" player, use [this][X] image.
* For the "O" player, use [this][O] image.
* When the player clicks an empty square, then it is filled with that player's
  symbol.
* When the player clicks a square that already contains a symbol, the game does
  nothing.
* The first click results in an "X". After that, the symbols "O" and "X"
  alternate with each click per the rules of tic-tac-toe.

During development, you can just refresh the browser to clear the board.

To make this game work, you'll eventually get around to checking if one of the
players won or if there is a tie. Refer back to TDD and OOP's Tic-Tac-Toe project
for the game logic.

Run `npm run test-2` when you have completed this phase to check that the basic turn-taking logic meets the minimum specs.

## Phase 3: Determining Game Status

In this step, you will determine if a game is won or in a tie state. A
reminder of the logic:

* If a player has any three in a row, then that player wins.
* If a player has any three in a column, then that player wins.
* If a player has either of the diagonals, then that player wins.
* If there is no win _and_ all squares have a player symbol in there, then
  the game is a tie.
* When the game begins, the header at the top should have no text in it.
* When a player wins the game, then the following happens:
  * The header at the top should read "Winner: X" or "Winner: O" depending on
    which player won.
  * Empty squares in the grid no longer react to clicks.
* When the game goes into a tied state, the header at the top should read
  "Winner: None".

Again, refer back to your TDD and OOP Tic-Tac-Toe project and make any necessary
updates.

Run `npm run test-3` when you have completed this phase to check that the basic win, loss and tie behavior meets the specs.

## Phase 4: Refactor

At this point, your code may be a bit unorganized with lots of lines of code.
Refactor your code. Keep DRY and SRP in mind when organizing your code. You may
want to try separating code blocks into functions or try implementing classes.
With any approach you take, a good way to organize your code is by separating
game logic from the UI or HTML element manipulation. That way, you can more
easily debug an error in your code by isolating it as a game logic error or a UI
error.

There are no new tests for phase 4, but run `npm run test-4` after refactoring
to ensure that the tests for phases 1-3 are all still passing.

## Phase 5: Creating a New Game

In this step, you will now program the "New Game" button. The button should
behave like so:

* When the game status is not "won" or "tied", then the "New Game" button is
  disabled.
* When the game status is "won" or "tied", then the "New Game" button is
  enabled.
* When a player clicks the "New Game" button, then it
  * clears the game status,
  * clears the header,
  * clears the board, and
  * makes it so the next click of the tic-tac-toe board is an "X"
  * (disables the "New Game" button)

Run `npm run test-5` when you have completed this phase to make sure the "New Game"
button behaves as expected.

## Phase 6: Giving Up

In this step, you will now make the "Give Up" button work. In the event one
user realized their impending doom, they may want to opt to immediately quit
and start a new game. Here's how it should work:

* When a player clicks the "Give Up" button:
  * Set the status of the game as "won" by the "other" player. That is, if "X"
    is the current player, when that player clicks the "Give Up" button, then
    "O" wins the game.
  * Show the winner status as won by the "other" player.
  * Disable the "Give Up" button.
  * Enable the "New Game" button.
* When a game is ongoing:
  * Enable the 'Give Up" button.

Run `npm run test-6` when you have completed this phase to make sure the "Give Up"
button behaves as expected.

## Phase 7: Saving Game State

In this phase, store the game state using your choice of storage so that when
the user refreshes the page, the game isn't reset. The only way to reset should
be by pressing the "New Game" button.

Run `npm run test-7` when you have completed this phase to make sure the game
state is persisted on refresh.

Finally, run `npm run test` to make sure ALL tests are passing on your completed
project.

## BONUS Phase

When you click "New Game", randomly assign the computer as Player X or Player O.
Then, have the computer play automatically in response to its turn.

For example, if you click "New Game" and the computer becomes Player X, then it
will play an "X" on the board. Then, you will play an "O". After you click your
square, the computer will automatically play its "X". And, so on.

If the computer is Player O, then it will play after you play your first "X".

_There are no test specs for the bonus phase._
