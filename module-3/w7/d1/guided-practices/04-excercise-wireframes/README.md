# Exercise: HTML Wireframe

Wireframes are quick, lightweight outlines design specs that layout a web page.
Being able to discuss and plan your core elements allows your web page to have
a solid foundation to build on. This is an important skill when you work on
web design and development.

In this exercise, you will be identifying and discussing semantic HTML syntax
from an example wireframe.

Identify what HTML elements you think each part in the wireframe should be.

Which parts in the wireframe should the following HTML tags be assigned to?

- Main Heading (h1)
- Subheading (h2)
- Main Image (img)
- Text paragraphs (p)
- Links (underlined blue text) (a)
- Lists (ul, ol, li)
- Sections (div)
- Social media icons (identify what tag a social media icon is)

Are there any other HTML tags that should be assigned to a part in the
wireframe?
