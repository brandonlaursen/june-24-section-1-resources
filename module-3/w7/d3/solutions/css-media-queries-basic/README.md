# Practice: CSS Media Queries

In this practice, you will use media queries to improve a web page.

## Set up

1. Clone the practice from the starter.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm test` to run the Cypress tests after completing each phase.

Once you're in VS Code, you can drag the __index.html__ file into your browser
to view the webpage, or use the **File Explorer** to open it in your browser.
The only file you will need to edit for this practice is __main.css__.

> Remember to save the CSS file and refresh the page in the browser whenever you
> make changes.

## Background and Context

The content and common styles have already been done for you, so you only need
to add __media queries__ to the CSS.

## Phase 1: Layout adjustments

Here are the designer's mockups for various screen sizes. What's already
implemented covers the extremely narrow and narrow cases. The Cypress tests for
these two cases are already passing.

Please implement the "moderate" and "wide" cases. The moderate option is for
more than 850 pixels and the wide option is for 1220 pixels or more.

When you finish Phase 1, run the Cypress tests. Make sure that the first five
tests are passing after making your layout adjustments. _The sixth test may
challenge you to refactor your solution - can you do it without changing the
default layout values for the `.sidebar` class?_

> Note: The following images are scaled down to fit into the instructions.
> You can right click and select "Open Image in New Tab" to see them full-size.

### Extremely Narrow (already implemented)

Only the header is included because the rest of the page is the same as narrow.

## Phase 2: Printing

The customer noticed that the printout is using a lot of color. To solve this,
the site owner says that the only important information to include in the
printout is the story itself, and it's okay to always print it without the
purple background color.

Please hide everything except the story and make the background white when the
page is printed.

## Bonus Phase

The designer saw the new printout and asked if it would be possible to include
the image. Here's a mockup of their vision.

Can you make the print out look like this?
