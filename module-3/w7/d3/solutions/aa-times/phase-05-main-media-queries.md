# Intermediate Phase: Main Page Media Queries

You have made it so that the Web site will render well on large screens. Now
it's time to make it responsive to different device widths.

## Medium screens

When the Web page is less than 1200, you need to hide the secondary column of
news stories and make the primary column fit the width of the page. Add that
media query into **main-content.html**

## Small screens

When the page is less than 1000 pixels wide, remove the interests bar. You have
already implemented this media query in phase 3, but now is a great time to test
that the content is still rendering as expected.
